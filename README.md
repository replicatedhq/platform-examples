# Replicated Platform Examples

This repository contains a collection of examples for users of the Replicated
platform. Examples are divided broadly into two categories: applications and
patterns. _Applications_ show complete applications that take advantage of many
features of the platform, while _Patterns_ show a simple reusable solution to a
common problem you might encounter while distributing your software with
Replicated.
