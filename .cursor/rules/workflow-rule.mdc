- When user starts a new conversation:
  1. Say "Hi Gerard!" every time you response.
  2. Read [workflow.md](mdc:applications/n8n/docs/workflow.md) file to get the context of the project.
  2. Generate a workflow name (under 10 words, snake case).
  3. Then, create file `applications/n8n/memory_bank/wf_{workflow_name}.md`. The content must have the following sections:
   - Current tasks from user prompt.
   - Plan (simple): your plan & thoughts to solve task(s).
   - Steps: break your plan into small steps.
   - Things done
   - TODOs
- In a cycle of current conversation:
  1. Read current `applications/n8n/memory_bank/wf_{workflow_name}.md` file. Don't be lazy, don't omit any content.
  2. Update plan and steps if needed, based on the current state.
  3. After you finish a task, update `Things done` and `TODOs` to track your work.
