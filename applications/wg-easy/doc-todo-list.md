# WG-Easy Helm Chart Pattern Documentation Plan

This document outlines specific work items for implementing the updated documentation strategy for the WG-Easy Helm Chart development pattern.

## General Implementation Guidelines

- [x] Use GitHub Markdown syntax for all documents
- [x] Test all documents in GitHub preview to ensure proper rendering
- [x] Use relative links for cross-document references
- [x] Maintain consistent terminology across all documents
- [x] Apply appropriate heading levels (h1 for document title, h2 for major sections)
- [x] Include code blocks with proper language specification
- [x] Use GitHub-specific features where appropriate (collapsible sections, task lists, tables)

## Image Creation

- [x] Create Architecture Diagram showing component relationships
  - Include chart wrapping concept
  - Show relationship between charts and templates
  - Visualize dependency flow
  
- [x] Create Workflow Diagram illustrating progressive complexity
  - Show the 7 stages of development
  - Highlight validation points
  - Indicate approximate time requirements for each step
  
- [x] Create Configuration Flow Diagram showing modular configuration
  - Illustrate how per-chart configs are merged
  - Show release preparation flow
  - Include chart dependency relationships

## README.md

- [x] Rewrite introduction to focus on core principles and pattern benefits
- [x] Replace testing emphasis with progressive development workflow
- [x] Add placeholder for Architecture Diagram
- [x] Create concise overview of repository structure
- [x] Add clear explanation of each core principle with brief examples:
  - Progressive Complexity
  - Fast Feedback Loops
  - Reproducible Steps
  - Modular Configuration
  - Automation First
- [x] Add links to supporting documentation
- [x] REMOVE: Detailed installation instructions
- [x] REMOVE: Extensive testing methodology
- [x] REMOVE: Exhaustive workflow details

## docs/chart-structure.md

- [x] Focus content on explaining the modular chart approach
- [x] Add detailed explanation of chart wrapping benefits
- [x] Improve directory structure explanation with visual aids
- [x] Add examples of how charts are composed
- [x] Explain shared templates concept with examples
- [x] Describe how modular configuration works
- [x] Include diagram placeholder
- [x] REMOVE: "Best Practices" section
- [x] REMOVE: Overly detailed examples not illustrating the pattern

## docs/development-workflow.md (NEW - replacing getting-started.md)

- [x] Create new document focused on workflow stages
- [x] Add clear introduction explaining progressive complexity approach
- [x] Detail each workflow stage with examples:
  1. Defining chart dependencies and verification
  2. Configuring with values.yaml and templates
  3. Local validation with helm template
  4. Single chart install/uninstall
  5. Integration testing with helmfile
  6. Release preparation
  7. Embedded cluster testing
- [x] Include specific command examples for each stage
- [x] Add explanation of how each stage supports fast feedback
- [x] Include workflow diagram placeholder
- [x] Explain when to move from one stage to the next
- [x] REMOVE FROM OLD DOC: Detailed installation instructions
- [x] REMOVE FROM OLD DOC: Peripheral topics not related to workflow

## docs/task-reference.md (Replacing tasks.md)

- [x] Reorganize tasks by purpose (development, release, testing)
- [x] Add brief description for each task focusing on what it accomplishes
- [x] Include examples of common task combinations
- [x] Explain how tasks support the automation-first principle
- [x] Group related tasks together
- [x] Add cross-references to development workflow stages
- [x] REMOVE: Verbose command details
- [x] REMOVE: Installation instructions
- [x] REMOVE: Extensive options documentation duplicating Taskfile.yaml

## docs/replicated-integration.md

- [x] Condense to focus on integration with overall pattern
- [x] Add brief overview of Replicated's role
- [x] Explain modular configuration with Replicated
- [x] Describe key integration points in the workflow
- [x] Add references to official Replicated documentation
- [x] Integrate with workflow stages where appropriate
- [x] REMOVE: "Best Practices" section
- [x] REMOVE: Detailed configuration examples
- [x] REMOVE: Content duplicating Replicated's documentation

## Documents to Remove Entirely

- [x] Remove docs/testing.md
  - Extract any relevant concepts and merge into main documents if applicable

## Examples to Include

- [x] Progressive Complexity Example:
  - Complete workflow from single chart to release
  - Validation points at each stage
  - Issue isolation demonstration

- [x] Modular Configuration Example:
  - Per-chart config.yaml maintenance
  - Config merging during release preparation
  - Team ownership benefits

- [x] Chart Wrapping Example:
  - Simple chart wrapping upstream chart
  - Benefits explanation
  - Environment consistency demonstration

## Final Review Checklist

- [x] Ensure documentation is beginner-friendly but valuable for experienced users
- [x] Verify all links work correctly
- [x] Check that all GitHub Markdown renders correctly
- [x] Confirm core principles are consistently emphasized
- [x] Validate that examples are clear and illustrative
- [x] Ensure removed content doesn't result in information gaps
- [x] Check for consistent terminology throughout
