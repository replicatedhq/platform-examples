# Tools Selection Decision Document

## Introduction

This document explains the tool selection decisions for the wg-easy Helm chart development workflow, focusing on why certain tools were chosen over alternatives, their trade-offs, best practices, and limitations.

## Selected Tools

### Taskfile

**Why chosen**: 
- Task provides a simple, cross-platform way to automate repetitive development tasks
- Offers a declarative YAML-based approach that's easier to understand than Make
- Supports dependencies between tasks, allowing for complex workflows
- Enables parameterization and defaults for flexible task execution

**Alternatives considered**:
- Make: Traditional but less modern, complex syntax, not as cross-platform friendly
- Bash scripts: Less structured, harder to maintain, lacks built-in dependency handling
- Just: Similar to Task but with fewer features and smaller community
- Grunt/Gulp: More complex, JavaScript-based, heavier than needed

**Trade-offs**:
- Requires installation of the Task tool (though it's a single binary)
- Not as universally available as Make
- Slightly less performant than pure bash scripts for very simple tasks

**Best practices**:
- Group related tasks in separate YAML files for better organization
- Use task dependencies rather than chaining commands
- Provide sensible defaults for all parameters
- Include good descriptions for all tasks
- Structure tasks to be composable for different workflows

**Limitations**:
- Learning curve for developers not familiar with the tool
- Requires separate installation on CI systems
- Debugging can be more complex than with plain scripts

### Replicated CLI

**Why chosen**:
- Native integration with Replicated platform
- Comprehensive support for all Replicated operations
- Consistent interface for application lifecycle management
- Excellent support for automation via scripting

**Alternatives considered**:
- Custom API clients: More complex to develop and maintain
- Web UI: Not suitable for automation
- Third-party tools: None available with comparable Replicated integration

**Trade-offs**:
- Tied to Replicated ecosystem
- Requires authentication setup

**Best practices**:
- Store authentication in environment variables for security
- Use JSON output for scripting integration
- Create composable commands for complex operations
- Leverage the CLI's validation capabilities before release operations

**Limitations**:
- Only works with Replicated platform
- Requires keeping CLI version in sync with platform updates

### Helm/Helmfile

**Why chosen**:
- Helm is the de facto standard for Kubernetes package management
- Helmfile provides orchestration for multi-chart deployments with proper sequencing
- Both support templating and value overrides for flexible configuration
- Strong ecosystem and community support

**Alternatives considered**:
- Kustomize: More native to Kubernetes, but less powerful for complex deployments
- kubectl apply: Too basic for managing complex application deployments
- Operators: More complex, better for runtime operations than deployments

**Trade-offs**:
- Adds abstraction layer over raw Kubernetes manifests
- Template logic can become complex
- Potential version compatibility issues

**Best practices**:
- Maintain chart dependencies explicitly
- Use subchart grouping for logically related components
- Leverage Helm's testing capabilities
- Follow Helm best practices for chart structure
- Use Helmfile for orchestrating multi-chart deployments

**Limitations**:
- Learning curve for Helm templating syntax
- Debugging rendered templates can be challenging
- No built-in support for CRD timing issues

## Why Not Terraform

While Terraform was listed as an available tool, it was not selected as a primary tool for this workflow for the following reasons:

- **Scope mismatch**: Terraform excels at infrastructure provisioning, but our focus is on application deployment
- **Overlap with Kubernetes**: Using Terraform for Kubernetes resources creates redundancy with Helm
- **Complexity**: Adds another tool chain and state management concerns
- **Learning curve**: Requires additional expertise beyond Kubernetes/Helm knowledge

Terraform could be valuable for provisioning the underlying infrastructure (like GCP VMs), but for Helm chart development and testing, the selected tools provide a more streamlined workflow.

## Conclusion

The selected tools (Taskfile, Replicated CLI, and Helm/Helmfile) offer the best combination of features for a progressive development workflow that prioritizes fast feedback, reproducibility, and automation. Each tool addresses specific needs in the workflow while maintaining a balance between power and simplicity.

These tools also allow us to implement the key principles outlined in the design document:
- **Progressive Complexity**: Task dependencies allow starting simple and adding complexity
- **Fast Feedback**: Helm's templating and testing provide immediate validation
- **Reproducibility**: Declarative configs ensure consistent environments
- **Modular Configuration**: Helm values and Replicated config provide clear separation
- **Automation**: Task automates repetitive operations
