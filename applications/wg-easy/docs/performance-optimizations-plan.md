# Performance Optimizations Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines performance improvements for the wg-easy PR validation workflow. The current workflow, while comprehensive, has opportunities for optimization in job parallelization, resource utilization, API call reduction, and overall execution time.

## Current State

**Current Performance Characteristics:**
- Sequential job execution with dependencies
- Multiple API calls for resource existence checks
- Full artifact uploads for each workflow run
- Individual tool installations per job
- Redundant kubeconfig and setup operations

**Updated Context (January 2025):**
- ✅ **Compatibility Matrix Testing** - Phase 2 Complete with 6 parallel matrix combinations
- ✅ **Matrix-Based Parallelization** - Jobs run in parallel across distributions
- ✅ **Resource Optimization** - Priority-based resource allocation implemented
- ✅ **Advanced Caching** - Tool caching and dependency management enhanced

**Performance Bottlenecks (Updated):**
- Matrix multiplication effect: 6x resource usage with matrix testing
- API rate limiting potential with multiple parallel jobs
- Increased complexity in resource management and cleanup
- Higher parallel job coordination overhead
- Enhanced debugging complexity with matrix combinations

## Proposed Enhancement

### Performance Optimization Strategy

Target areas for improvement (Updated for Matrix Testing):

1. **Matrix Optimization:** Optimize parallel matrix job execution
2. **API Rate Limit Management:** Handle increased API calls from matrix jobs
3. **Resource Allocation:** Improve resource distribution across matrix combinations
4. **Caching Strategy:** Enhance caching for matrix-based workflows
5. **Workflow Coordination:** Optimize job coordination with matrix dependencies

## Technical Implementation

### Parallel Job Structure

```yaml
jobs:
  setup:
    # Quick setup job
    
  validate-and-package:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        task: [validate, package, lint, template]
    # Parallel validation and packaging
    
  create-resources:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        resource: [channel, customer, cluster]
    # Parallel resource creation
    
  test-deployment:
    needs: [create-resources]
    # Optimized deployment testing
```

### API Call Optimization

```yaml
- name: Batch Resource Check
  run: |
    # Single API call to check multiple resources
    curl -s -H "Authorization: ${{ env.REPLICATED_API_TOKEN }}" \
      "https://api.replicated.com/vendor/v3/batch" \
      -d '{
        "requests": [
          {"method": "GET", "path": "/channels"},
          {"method": "GET", "path": "/customers"},
          {"method": "GET", "path": "/clusters"}
        ]
      }'
```

### Caching Strategy

```yaml
- name: Cache Dependencies
  uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: |
      ~/.cache/helm
      ~/.cache/go-build
      ~/go/pkg/mod
      ~/.task
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-dependencies-${{ hashFiles('**/go.sum', '**/Chart.lock') }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-dependencies-
```

### Resource Optimization

```yaml
- name: Optimize Resource Usage
  run: |
    # Set resource limits
    export GOMAXPROCS=2
    export HELM_CACHE_HOME=/tmp/helm-cache
    
    # Optimize memory usage
    helm repo update --debug=false
    helm dependency update --skip-refresh
```

## Optimization Strategies
