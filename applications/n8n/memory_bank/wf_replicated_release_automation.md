# Replicated Release Automation

## Current tasks from user prompt
- Add a task to the justfile to call dagger for creating a replicated release

## Plan (simple)
Create a new task in the justfile that allows users to create a replicated release with Dagger using specified version and channel parameters. The task will leverage environment variables for sensitive information (API token).

## Steps
1. Read the existing justfile to understand current structure
2. Add a new task called `create-replicated-release` that accepts version and channel parameters
3. Make sure the task uses environment variables for sensitive tokens
4. Test the implementation

## Things done
- Added `create-replicated-release` task to the justfile that:
  - Takes version and channel as parameters
  - Uses environment variable for REPLICATED_API_TOKEN
  - Calls dagger with appropriate parameters

## TODOs
- Verify the implementation works as expected
- Consider adding documentation about this task in the workflow documentation
- Consider adding input validation or help text for parameter usage
