# Current tasks from user prompt
- Update the justfile with a new task `update-replicated-values` that accepts `customer_name` and `channel_name` parameters
- The task should:
  1. Create a replicated customer with the given name and channel
  2. Extract the license ID
  3. Login to the replicated registry with the license ID
  4. Show values from the replicated Helm chart
  5. Extract the global block and append to n8n-values.yaml
  6. Logout from the replicated registry
- Update the justfile task to append the entire global block, not just the content under global

# Plan (simple)
1. Read the existing justfile to understand the format and pattern
2. Create a new task called update-replicated-values with the required parameters
3. Implement the commands as specified in the user's request
4. Ensure proper formatting and consistent style with the existing justfile
5. Update the yq command to preserve the global structure when appending to n8n-values.yaml

# Steps
1. Read the existing justfile
2. Create a new task update-replicated-values with customer_name and channel_name parameters
3. Implement the command sequence with proper echo statements for feedback
4. Add the new task to the justfile
5. Update the yq command to use '{global: .global}' pattern instead of just '.global'

# Things done
- Read the existing justfile
- Reviewed the workflow documentation to understand context
- Created the new update-replicated-values task in the justfile with all required functionality:
  - Creating a replicated customer with name and channel
  - Extracting the license ID using grep and awk
  - Logging into the replicated registry
  - Showing values from the replicated Helm chart
  - Extracting the global block and appending to n8n-values.yaml
  - Logging out from the replicated registry
- Updated the yq command to preserve the global structure when appending to n8n-values.yaml
  - Changed from `yq '.global'` to `yq '{global: .global}'`
