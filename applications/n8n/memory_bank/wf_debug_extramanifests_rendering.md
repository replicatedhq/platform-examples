## Current tasks from user prompt
Debug why extraManifests in the n8n Helm chart are not rendering despite being defined in the values file.

## Plan (simple)
1. Examine the extraManifests.yaml template to understand how it processes values
2. Check how the values are structured in prod.yaml
3. Verify that the values files are being properly loaded when the chart is deployed
4. Identify potential issues preventing rendering

## Steps
1. Analyze the extraManifests.yaml template logic
2. Check the usage of .Values.extraManifests in the template
3. Investigate potential conditions where extraManifests would be skipped
4. Check the deployment process and debug commands

## Things done
- Examined extraManifests.yaml template structure
- Checked prod.yaml for extraManifests definition
- Ran helm template command to verify the extraManifests are not being rendered
- Analyzed the values.yaml file to check default extraManifests structure
- Added debug output to see what values are being processed
- Fixed the structure/location of the extraManifests section in prod.yaml
- Successfully verified that extraManifests are now being rendered correctly

## Solution
The issue was that although extraManifests was properly indented in prod.yaml, the values weren't being passed correctly to the chart. 

We initially thought the problem might be related to the nesting of values under the `n8n` key in prod.yaml, but by adding debug output to the extraManifests.yaml template, we discovered that `.Values.extraManifests` was being received as an empty array `[]`.

Upon further investigation, we found that since we're using the chart directly with `./n8n` in the helmfile, not as a dependency, the Helm values are already being applied at the root level of the values file, meaning extraManifests should be at the root level of the YAML structure.

The debug output helped us confirm this - when we left extraManifests at the root level of prod.yaml, it worked correctly. The Helm template successfully rendered the PostgreSQL Cluster resource.

## Key Takeaways
1. When using a chart directly (not as a dependency), Helm values should be at the root level of the values file
2. Adding debug output can help diagnose Helm template rendering issues
3. The extraManifests feature is working correctly but requires proper value structure
