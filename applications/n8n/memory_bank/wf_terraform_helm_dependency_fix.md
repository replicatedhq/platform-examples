## Current tasks from user prompt
- Fix Terraform failing to detect changes to the Helm chart dependencies (replicated)
- Make sure Terraform runs helm upgrade with the new changes

## Plan (simple)
1. Understand why Terraform is not detecting the changes to Chart.yaml
2. Find a solution to make Terraform aware of the new dependency
3. Apply the changes to ensure Terraform performs helm upgrade correctly

## Steps
1. Check the current Terraform configuration for the Helm release
2. Look for any mechanisms to update dependencies before applying
3. Identify if we need to add a lifecycle or trigger mechanism to detect changes
4. Implement the solution

## Things done
- Identified that the Helm chart has a new dependency "replicated" added to Chart.yaml
- Found a justfile command `helm-dep-update` that updates Helm dependencies for the n8n chart
- Added a local-exec provisioner to the Terraform helm_release resource to run helm dependency update before applying
- Added recreate_pods = timestamp() to force Terraform to redeploy when Chart.yaml changes, making it recognize the changes to dependencies

## TODOs
- Run `terraform apply` to test if the solution works
- Verify that the Helm chart is deployed with the replicated dependency
