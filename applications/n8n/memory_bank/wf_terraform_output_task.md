# Terraform Output Task Workflow

## Current tasks from user prompt
- Add a new task to do a terraform output in the justfile

## Plan (simple)
1. Understand the current justfile structure
2. Add a new task called terraform-output to run the terraform output command
3. Ensure it follows the same pattern as other existing terraform-related tasks

## Steps
1. Read the current justfile to understand its structure
2. Identify the appropriate location to add the new terraform-output task
3. Add the new task to the justfile
4. Test to ensure it works as expected (if needed)

## Things done
- Read the current justfile and understood its structure
- Added the terraform-output task after the set-replicated-values task
- The task includes an echo statement and the terraform output command

## TODOs
- None - task completed
