# Helm Dependency Update for n8n Chart

## Current tasks from user prompt
- Create a new task to run helm dependency update for the n8n chart
- Update the task to first log out from the Replicated registry before running helm dependency update

## Plan (simple)
1. Add a new task in the justfile to run helm dependency update for the n8n chart
2. Include helm registry logout for registry.replicated.com before running the update
3. Ensure the command navigates to the correct directory where Chart.yaml is located before running the helm dependency update command

## Steps
1. Create or update the justfile with a new task called 'helm-dep-update'
2. Add command to log out from registry.replicated.com
3. Make the task execute the helm dependency update command in the charts/n8n directory
4. Add appropriate echo commands to provide feedback during execution

## Things done
- Created a new task 'helm-dep-update' in the justfile 
- Added command to log out from registry.replicated.com first
- The task navigates to charts/n8n directory and runs 'helm dependency update'
- Added feedback messages to show when each command is running

## TODOs
- Test the task by running 'just helm-dep-update'
