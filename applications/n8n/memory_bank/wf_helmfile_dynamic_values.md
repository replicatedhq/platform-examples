# Helmfile Dynamic Values Integration

## Current tasks from user prompt
- Update helmfile.yaml to include dynamic values from environment-specific YAML files
- Configure helmfile to use dev.yaml or prod.yaml based on the selected environment name

## Plan (simple)
1. Understand the current helmfile.yaml structure
2. Examine the existing values files in the values directory
3. Modify the helmfile.yaml to dynamically load values based on environment name
4. Test the changes by applying them to the helmfile.yaml

## Steps
1. Read the current helmfile.yaml to understand configuration
2. Check values/dev.yaml and values/prod.yaml to understand what values need to be included
3. Update the n8n release in helmfile.yaml to include a values section that uses `{{ .Environment.Name }}` to dynamically select the right values file
4. Verify the modifications work correctly

## Things done
- Read and analyzed the current helmfile.yaml structure
- Examined the values files in the values directory
- Successfully updated the n8n release in helmfile.yaml to include: `values: [values/{{ .Environment.Name }}.yaml]`
- Verified that the changes were properly applied to the helmfile.yaml file

## TODOs
- Test the configuration by running helmfile with different environments:
  - `helmfile -e dev apply` to test with dev values
  - `helmfile -e prod apply` to test with prod values
- Consider adding additional configuration if needed for specific use cases
